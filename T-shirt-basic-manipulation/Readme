A T-shirt is manipulated by changing JSON files.

This has various, very basic manipulation tasks:
-> T-shirt falling under gravity (tshirt-falling.json)
-> T-shirt falling under gravity when pinned from 1 point (tshirt1pinfall.json)
-> T-shirt falling under gravity when pinner from 2 points (tshirt2pinfall.json)
-> T-shirt moving by two points synchronously (tshirt2pin-move.json)
-> T-shirt moving by two points, points moving asynchronously (tshirt2pin-move-random.json)

Results are in 'results' folder.
